# Finnish Adjectives

An alphapetical list of Finnish ascii-only adjectives (ie. no scandinavian characters) as a json file. Originally created for automated username generation.

The latest version of the list is available at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uninen/finnish-adjectives/main/adjectives.json`
